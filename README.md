The paper is currently under review. Citations to the published paper will be shared here in the future.

The abstract of the paper is as follows:<br/>
>The Internet has significantly expanded the potential for global collaboration, allowing millions of users to contribute to collective projects like Wikipedia. While prior work has assessed the success of online >collaborations, most approaches are time-agnostic, evaluating success without considering its longevity.
>Research on the factors that ensure the long-term preservation of high-quality standards in online collaboration is scarce.
>In this study, we address this gap. We propose a novel metric, ‘Sustainable Success’, which measures the ability of collaborative efforts to maintain their quality over time.
>Using Wikipedia as a case study, we introduce the SustainPedia dataset, which compiles data from over 40K Wikipedia articles, including each article’s sustainable success label and more than 300 explanatory features such >as edit history, user experience, and team composition.
>Using this dataset, we develop machine learning models to predict the sustainable success of Wikipedia articles.
>Our best-performing model achieves a high AU-ROC score of 0.88 on average. Our analysis reveals important insights. For example, we find that the longer an article takes to be recognized as high-quality, the more likely >it is to maintain that status over time (i.e., be sustainable). Additionally, user experience emerged as the most critical predictor of sustainability. Our analysis provides insights into broader collective actions beyond >Wikipedia (e.g., online activism, crowdsourced open-source software), where the same social dynamics that drive success on Wikipedia might play a role. We make all data and code used for this study publicly available for >further research.
